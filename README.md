This project utilizes React, Redux, Node, Mongoose, and Express to deliver a new type of CrossFit experience.
Upon logging in, users can use stopwatch functionality to replace that pesky wall clock in a CrossFit box, as well as a Wodify integrated workout section which displays the WOD in the same clarity as the whiteboard at the gym![Please note the information in program.js about this particular part of the project, thank you.] Stopwatch laps can be added as needed to save your times for certain parts of your workout.
Fully responsive on all screen sizes, WOD Clock is ready to go in 3...2...1!
